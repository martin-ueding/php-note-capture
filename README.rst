note-capture
############

Suite of scripts to add tasks to Taskwarrior_ on the go.

There is a website (written in Python 2 with Flask) that can be used from any
mobile device. Then, ``notes-download`` is used to download those notes. It is
written in Python 3.

The notes are saved in JSON on your webserver. You will have to set up a HTTP
auth scheme to protect it.

Requirements
============

On the Webserver
----------------

- Apache 2 Webserver
- Python 2
- python-flask
- write access in the directory ``/var/www/note-capture``

Locally
-------

- Python 3
- Taskwarrior_ as the ``task`` command

Installation
============

Server

   following::

    [reset]
